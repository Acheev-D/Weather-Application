Python Real-Time Weather Application
This Python-based application is engineered to fetch and display live weather information for any user-specified city. It serves as a practical demonstration of API integration using Python, resulting in a simple, interactive, and functional utility.
The application utilizes the WeatherAPI service to retrieve current weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions. A Graphical User Interface (GUI), built with Tkinter, ensures weather details are presented in a clean, organized manner.
Key development areas included:
Executing API calls via the requests library.
Effectively handling and processing JSON data.
Creating an intuitive and robust GUI.
Dynamically updating the display with real-time data.
Establishing a basic understanding of API-based development workflows.
The project provides a beginner-friendly model for constructing practical Python applications that interact with external services.
